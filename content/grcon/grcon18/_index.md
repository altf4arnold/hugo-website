## 8th Annual GRCon

GRCon is the annual conference for the GNU Radio project & community, and has established itself as one of the premier industry events for Software Radio. It is a week-long conference that includes high-quality technical content and valuable networking opportunities. GRCon is a venue that highlights design, implementation, and theory that has been practically applied in a useful way. The conference has grown in size every year, and we are once again expecting significant growth this year. GRCon attendees come from a large variety of backgrounds, including industry, academia, government, and hobbyists.

GRCon18 was held at the Henderson Convention Center in Henderson, Nevada, a suburb of Las Vegas, Nevada.

With an annual program that has broad appeal, GRCon attracts people new to Software Radio just looking to learn more, folks that want to keep their finger on the pulse & direction of the industry, and seasoned developers ready to show off their latest work.
