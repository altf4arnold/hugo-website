## 10th Annual GNU Radio Conference

GNU Radio Conference (GRCon) is the annual conference for the GNU Radio project & community, and has
established itself as one of the premier industry events for Software Radio. It
is a week-long conference that includes high-quality technical content and
valuable networking opportunities. GRCon is a venue that highlights design,
implementation, and theory that has been practically applied in a useful way.
GRCon attendees come from a large variety of backgrounds, including industry,
academia, government, and hobbyists.

GRCon20 ran September 14-18 as a virtual event. The organizing team focused on creating a fun and interactive experience. 

Our keynote speakers included: Becky Schoenfeld W1BXY, managing editor of QST magazine, 
and Oona Räisänen [ windytan ] hacker of signals and computer programmer. 

With an annual program that has broad appeal, GRCon attracts people new to
Software Radio just looking to learn more, experts that want to keep their finger
on the pulse & direction of the industry, and seasoned developers ready to show
off their latest work.
